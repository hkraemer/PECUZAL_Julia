    AbstractNeighborhood
Supertype of methods for deciding the neighborhood of points for a given point.

Concrete subtypes:
* `FixedMassNeighborhood(K::Int)` :
  The neighborhood of a point consists of the `K`
  nearest neighbors of the point.
* `FixedSizeNeighborhood(ε::Real)` :
  The neighborhood of a point consists of all
  neighbors that have distance < `ε` from the point.

See [`neighborhood`](@ref) for more.

"""
    neighborhood(point, tree, ntype)
    neighborhood(point, tree, ntype, n::Int, w::Int = 1)

Return a vector of indices which are the neighborhood of `point` in some
`data`, where the `tree` was created using `tree = KDTree(data [, metric])`.
The `ntype` is the type of neighborhood and can be any subtype
of [`AbstractNeighborhood`](@ref).

Use the second method when the `point` belongs in the data,
i.e. `point = data[n]`. Then `w` stands for the Theiler window (positive integer).
Only points that have index
`abs(i - n) ≥ w` are returned as a neighborhood, to exclude close temporal neighbors.
The default `w=1` is the case of excluding the `point` itself.

## References

`neighborhood` simply interfaces the functions
`NearestNeighbors.knn` and `inrange` from
[NearestNeighbors.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl) by using
the argument `ntype`.
