    pecuzal_embedding(s; kwargs...) → Y, τ_vals, ts_vals, Ls ,⟨ε★⟩
A unified approach to properly embed a time series or a set of time series
(`Dataset`) based on the ideas of Pecora et al. [^Pecoral2007] and Uzal et al.
[^Uzal2011].

## Keyword arguments

* `τs = 0:50`: Possible delay values `τs` (in sampling time units). For each of
  the `τs`'s the continuity statistic ⟨ε★⟩ gets computed and further processed
  in order to find optimal delays `τᵢ` for each embedding cycle `i` (read
  algorithm description).
* `w::Int = 1`: Theiler window (neighbors in time with index `w` close to the point,
  that are excluded from being true neighbors). `w=0` means to exclude only the
  point itself, and no temporal neighbors.
* `samplesize::Real = 1`: determine the fraction of all phase space points
  (=`length(s)`) to be considered (fiducial points v) to average ε★, in order to
  produce `⟨ε★⟩`.
* `K::Int = 13`: the amount of nearest neighbors in the δ-ball (read algorithm
  description). Must be at least 8 (in order to gurantee a valid statistic).
  `⟨ε★⟩` is computed taking the minimum result over all `k ∈ K`.
* `KNN::Int = 3`: the amount of nearest neighbors considered, in order to compute
  σ_k^2 (read algorithm description [`uzal_cost`]@ref). If given a vector, the
  minimum result over all `knn ∈ KNN` is returned.
* `α::Real = 0.05`: The significance level for obtaining the continuity statistic
* `p::Real = 0.5`: The p-parameter for the binomial distribution used for the
  computation of the continuity statistic ⟨ε★⟩.
* `max_cycles = 50`: The algorithm will stop after that many cycles no matter what.


## Description
The method works iteratively and gradually builds the final embedding vectors
`Y`. Based on the `⟨ε★⟩`-statistic [`pecora`](@ref) the algorithm picks an
optimal delay value `τᵢ` for each embedding cycle i.
For achieving that, we take the inpute time series `s` and compute the continuity
statistic `⟨ε★⟩`. 1. Each local maxima in `⟨ε★⟩` is used for constructing a
candidate embedding trajectory `Y_trial` with a delay corresponding to that
specific peak in `⟨ε★⟩`. 2. We then compute the `L`-statistic [`uzal_cost`](@ref)
for `Y_trial`. 3. We pick the peak/`τ`-value, for which `L` is minimal and
construct the actual embedding trajectory `Y_actual` (steps 1.-3. correspond to
an embedding cycle). 4. We repeat steps 1.-3. with `Y_actual` as input and stop
the algorithm when `L` can not be reduced anymore. `Y_actual` -> `Y`.

In case of multivariate embedding, i.e. when embedding a set of M time series
(`s::Dataset`), in each embedding cycle the continuity statistic `⟨ε★⟩` gets
computed for all M time series available. The optimal delay value `τ` in each
embedding cycle is chosen as the peak/`τ`-value for which `L` is minimal under
all available peaks and under all M `⟨ε★⟩`'s. In the first embedding cycle there
will be M^2 different `⟨ε★⟩`'s to consider, since it is not clear a priori which
time series of the input should consitute the first component of the embedding
vector and form `Y_actual`.

The range of considered delay values is determined in `τs` and for the
nearest neighbor search we respect the Theiler window `w`. The final embedding
vector is stored in `Y` (`Dataset`). The chosen delay values for each embedding
cycle are stored in `τ_vals` and the according time series numbers chosen for
each delay value in `τ_vals` are stored in `ts_vals`. For univariate embedding
(`s::Vector`) `ts_vals` is a vector of ones of length `τ_vals`, because there is
simply just one time series to choose from. The function also returns the
`L`-statistic `Ls` for each embedding cycle and the continuity statistic `⟨ε★⟩`
as an `Array` of `Vector`s.

For distance computations the Euclidean norm is used.
